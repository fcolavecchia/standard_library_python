# standard_library_python
A dir structure to play with standard library of Python

This repo contains gibberish dirs and files, to be used to learn Python standard library `os` and `glob` modules. 

Created using [`randomfiletree`](randomfiletree.rtfd.io/) from [@klieret](https://github.com/klieret) and `os.urandom` from Python standard library.
